areas of friction:
when trying to run, I immediately got the following error: "The HttpOperationHandlerFactory is unable to determine the input parameter that should be associated with the request message content for service operation 'PostActive'. If the operation does not expect content in the request message use the HTTP GET method with the operation. Otherwise, ensure that one input parameter either has it's IsContentParameter property set to 'True' or is a type that is assignable to one of the following: HttpContent, ObjectContent`1, HttpRequestMessage or HttpRequestMessage`1."
the fact that i can't share configs between hosts just completely sucks and needs to be fixed


todo: 
home page
add new bug - should show up in pending
from pending list, activate the bug - should show up in active
from pending list, delete the bug (will tackle the details page later
from active list resolve - should show up in resolved list
from resolved list, close - should show up in closed list
