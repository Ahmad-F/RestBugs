changed all references and updated usings
formatters
	changed sync methods to async methods (e.g. OnWriteToStream -> OnWriteToStreamAsyc) and modified to use tasks
	++ was able to delete the WriteXx method when it is not used
	-- the formatter api is still crazy ugly
		method signature is really long
		i don't have a good sense of what happens if i don't just return a new task by default (e.g. what happens if i call base.OnXxX?)
message handlers
	++ hurray!  these haven't changed
services
	needed to change method names to HTTP Method conventions
	needed to refactor child resources into different controllers

hierarchies
	need to figure out how i'm going to represent hierarchies for active/pending/etc.
